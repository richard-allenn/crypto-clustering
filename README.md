# crypto-clustering
module 19 challenge


Overview
The Crypto Clustering project aims to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes using unsupervised learning techniques K-means clustering. The project uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on clustering to gain understanding of the impact of dimensional reduction.

# steps
1. data preparation
2. Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
3. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
4. Optimise Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
5. Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
6. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
7. analyse the impacts.
